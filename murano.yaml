assets:
  location: assets
  include: '**/*'
  exclude: ['**/.*']
  default_page: index.html

endpoint:
  #Start off with the directory name we want to keep everything in.
  location: endpoints

  #Then use globs to find all of the files that can contain route code.
  #If using single glob, then can be just the string.
  include: '**/*.lua'

  #Then remove all that match these globs. Again, if a single, can drop the array.
  #If not excluding, use empty array [], or empty node.
  exclude: ['*_test.lua', '*_spec.lua']

  #That leaves a list of files with API endpoints in them.  Each Route file can
  #contain one or more actual endpoints that are synced with Murano.
