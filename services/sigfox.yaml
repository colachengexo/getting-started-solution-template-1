serviceConfig: [] # This should not be required

# Following doesn't exists yet in config and is passed in createCallback function
# Defining it here could then use the x-exosite-init/update service event for auto-bootstrap.
# Then we woulnd need to to bootstrap the callback in the init.lua
# We could also defined in above serviceConfig instead
# callbacks:
#   - apiUser: "<your Sigfox api user name>",
#     #productId: => solution id
#     deviceTypeId: "<your Sigfox device type id>",
#     # How would ExoSense set the following from App?
#     payloadConfig: "temperature::uint:8 humidity::uint:8 alarm::bool:7",

#       data_in:
#         temperature: "{customData#temperature}",
#         humidity: "{customData#humidity}",
#         alarm: "{customData#alarm}"
#     # Consider using
#     payloadConfig: [{
#       resource: "data_in.temperature",
#       type: "uint",
