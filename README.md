# Getting Started Solution Template


## What needs to be included in this repo

- [x] sample yaml file for a solution application
- [x] need one (1) `assets/index.html` file
- [x] need one (1) `endpoint/example.lua` file
- [x] need one (1) `modules/example.lua` file
- [x] need one (1) `services/device.lua` file
- [ ] Documentation within example files (_& directories?_)
- [ ] _what else?_


## What needs to be done to get this to work

- [ ] 1) Platform support for the yaml file
- [ ] 2) Ticket in the MuranoCLI to support the `.yml` and `.yaml` extention instead of `.murano`
- [ ] 3) Convert the example repos from `Solutionfile.json` --to--> `murano.yml`
- [ ] 4) Document within each code file (what it does, why it's there, how to use, what options exists)


## Future

- Update examples to use `require`
-
