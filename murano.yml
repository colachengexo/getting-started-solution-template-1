  # The version of the Project
  version: 1.0.0


####
#
# The sections routes, assets, modules, and services are all optional.
#
# They all have defaults values that should work for a majority of the projects out
# there.  But they are all fully configurable to fit the way you want your project
# to be.
#
# Examples follow.
#
#
routes:
  #Start off with the directory name we want to keep everything in.
  location: endpoints

  #Then use globs to find all of the files that can contain route code.
  #If using single glob, then can be just the string.
  include: '**/*.lua'

  #Then remove all that match these globs. Again, if a single, can drop the array.
  #If not excluding, use empty array [], or empty node.
  exclude: ['*_test.lua', '*_spec.lua', '**/.*']

  #That leaves a list of files with API routes in them.  Each Route file can
  #contain one or more actual routes that are synced with Murano.
